# Description
As a manager of employees I want to be able to look at some non-classified information of the employees that work under me, such as name, employee Id, title, and department. I also want to be able to search for someone by name or id number. This application delivers that.

# Installation
Install by:
Simply have the files on your local machine and import your own employees.json file into the same spot as the existing file and it should read it just fine as long as the property names are the same.
# Usage
Scroll through the list of employees populated by the state of the application and the search bar allows you to look for a specific person by id or by name and will notify you to check spelling if there are no results.
